ERROR: It appears that the -base templateID that you passed:
       -base sub-ADS652
       is an existing regular (cross sectional) run!
       Please make sure you pass a new name (not one of
       the time points) for the template with -base.
       For example, if you are trying to create a -base:

       \' -base BertTemplate -tp Bert1 -tp Bert2 ... \'

WARNING: Image parameters differ across time, maybe due to aquisition changes?
         Consistent changes in, e.g., resolution can potentially bias a 
         longitudinal study! You can check image parameters by running mri_info
         on each input image. Will continue in 10 seconds ...

ERROR: it appears that recon-all is already running
for sub-ADS652 based on the presence of /gpfs/projects/adapt_lab/shared/ADS/data/BIDS_data/derivatives/freesurfer/sub-ADS652/scripts/IsRunning.lh+rh. It could
also be that recon-all was running at one point but
died in an unexpected way. If it is the case that there
is a process running, you can kill it and start over or
just let it run. If the process has died, you should type:

rm /gpfs/projects/adapt_lab/shared/ADS/data/BIDS_data/derivatives/freesurfer/sub-ADS652/scripts/IsRunning.lh+rh

and re-run. Or you can add -no-isrunning to the recon-all
