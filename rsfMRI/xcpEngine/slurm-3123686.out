___________________________________________________________________


   Usage: xcpEngine -d <design> <options>

   Compulsory arguments:
    -d : Primary design file for pipeline:
         The design file specifies the pipeline modules to
         be included in the current analysis and configures
         any parameters necessary to run the modules.
    -c : Cohort file for pipeline input:
         A comma-separated catalogue of the analytic sample.
         Each row corresponds to a subject, and each column
         corresponds either to an identifier or to an input.
    -o : Parent directory for pipeline output:
         A valid path on the current filesystem specifying
         the directory wherein all output from the current
         analysis will be written.

   Optional arguments:
    -m : Execution mode:
         Input can either be 's' (for serial execution on a
         single machine)[default], 'c' (for execution on a
         computing cluster) or a path to a file (for execution
         on a computing cluster, subject to the specifications
         defined in the file).
    -i : Scratch space for pipeline intermediates:
         Some systems operate more quickly when temporary
         files are written in a dedicated scratch space. This
         argument enables a scratch space for intermediates.
    -r : Root directory for inputs:
         If all paths defined in the cohort file are defined
         relative to a root directory, then this argument will
         define the root directory. Otherwise, all paths will
         be treated as absolute.
    -t : Trace:
         Integer value ( 0 - 3 ) that indicates the level
         of verbosity during module execution. Higher
         levels reduce readability but provide useful
         information for troubleshooting.
         0  [default]: Human-readable explanations of
            processing steps and error traces only.
         1: Explicitly trace module-level computations.
            Print a workflow map when execution completes.
         2: Explicitly trace module- and utility-level
            computations.
         3: All commands called by the module and all
            children are traced and explicitly replicated
            in a log file.
